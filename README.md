# Info

 <strong>River-USB</strong> is the solution to use a wired device wirelessly!
River-USB routes the USB device data from the River-USB port to the River-USB hub via a 5G connection for the fastest speed.

* River-USB small has 2 ports
* River-USB big has 4 ports

RiverUSB must be constantly connected to a power source (USB-C)
but can be up to 10m further away from the hub and still work without problems.
